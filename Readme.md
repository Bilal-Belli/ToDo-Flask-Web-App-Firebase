# To DO List (Flask Web Application)
> This is a web application developed by Bilal Belli in 2024.
 
> The goal is to improve by using multiple web stack technologies in combination. For example, here I used Firebase for database management to store and retrieve information, Flask for backend development, and Bootstrap to enhance the application's interface.

> Overall, this was a two-hour project. If it helps someone, I’d be glad to hear about it!
